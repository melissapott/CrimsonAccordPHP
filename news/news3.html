						The following text and phot was posted to multiple social media pages earlier today: "Hey all, Melinda Cole here.  Reports of my death, as they say, have been greatly exaggerated.  Found dead in my apartment...
						in my sleep, peacefully? No no no, this simply WILL NOT DO.  Rest assured dear readers, when my time does come, the entire world will bear witness and weep at my passing.  There will be throngs of mourners in 
						the streets, candlelight vigils will be held, and my face will be on t-shirts and billboards across the country.  But I'm not quite ready for all that just yet.  I've got quite a bit more to accomplish in this
						life, and it wouldn't be right to leave a job half finished.  To all the critics who said my time had come and gone, I have only this to say: You ain't seen nothin' yet.  Stay tuned, kids."

					My fellow residents of New Amsterdam, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your many years of support, and remind you that it was the bold leadership of this administration that conducted this city
					safely through the dark days that followed the heinous attack on the United Nations nearly 25 years ago.  Since then we have not only survived, byt flourished.  Tierside stands as a testament to what the residents of this 
					great city can accomplish with determination and strenght of will.  It has become as integral a component of this city as the Statue of Liberty of the World Trade Center.  My opponent Rick Robertson makes a lot of noise
					about the divide in the class system, and how rich and the poor are at odds with each other.  The way I see it, our diversity is our greatest asset.  Not every...

					I hear a lot of the same talk over and over from my opponent Mayor Kich; a lot fo the same rhetoric over the last 47 years.  His administration is a symptom of the broken political system that is New Amsterdam.  Tierside
					is a clear demonstration of the income inequality problem in our fair city.  It serves onl to polarize the community, separating us into the haves and the have nots, turning us against one another.  It's time for everyone
					to stop blaming each other for all our problems and start working together to make this city as strong as I believe it can be if we put our minds to it.  Friends, neighbors, family.  That's who the people of New Amsterdam
					are to me.  I want you all to know that I care deeply about the well being of each and every resident of this city, and as your next Mayor, I will ensure...
