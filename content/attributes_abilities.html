	<h1>Attributes</h1>
	<p>
		Attributes are the natural capabilities of your character.  How smart, intelligentor even how likeable they are.  The normal human range of
		masteryin Attributes and Abilities runs from one to five and examples of how each level differs is explained below.
	</p>
	<h3>Range of Human Mastery in Attributes</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Debilitated in some way, below average, incompetent (picked last when choosing teams)</li>
		<li>The average level of compentence (played sports as a hobby)</li>
		<li>Above average (was on a college varsity team)</li>
		<li>Talented (professional athlete)</li>
		<li>One of a kind, genius (Jesse Owens)</li>
	</ol>
	<p><em>Note: All ones in Attributes are semi-flaws, which are considered 'ingrained' into the character concept, and must be well explained in your
	background.  As such, they will require serious in game reason to buy up to two and will cost double XP to do so.</em></p>
	
	<h3>Attribute Points</h3>
	<p>These qualities are broken up into three categories: Physical, Social and Mental. </p>
	<p>Determine which Attribute group will be Primary, which will be secondary and which will be tertiary. (Ex. A Detective concept may choose Mental as the Primary group, Physical as the Secondary and Social as the Tertiary group.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>Each Attribute starts at one dot and may be raised with additional dots based on the player’s attribute grouping:</p>
		<ul class="list-unstyled">
			<li>Primary group: 7 extra dots to allocate</li>
			<li>Secondary group: 5 extra dots to allocate</li>
			<li>Tertiary group: 3 extra dots to allocate</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Attributes cannot be 5’s in character generation. 5’s need to be achieved through in game experience.</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<h3>Specialties</h3>
	<p>A character may claim a specialty for every dot above 3. So a 4 in an attribute would allow one specialty, a 5 allows two specialties.</p>
	<p>Attribute Specialties may not be bought with Experience. Each roll that involves a specialty will allow every ‘10’ rolled to count as 2 successes. (This eliminates the hassle of re-rolling 10’s and accruing a botch.)</p>
	
	<h1>Abilities</h1>
	<p>This is what the character learned over the years. These qualities are broken up into three categories: Talents, Skills and Knowledges. 
		Determine which Ability group will be Primary, which will be secondary and which will be tertiary. (Ex. A Scholar concept may choose Knowledges as 
		the Primary group, Skills as the Secondary and Talents as the Tertiary group.</p>
	<p>Each Ability starts at zero dots and may be raised with additional dots based on the player’s point allocation.</p>
	<p>27 points are allocated in Abilities.</p>
	<p><em>Note: Having a zero in an Ability means the character is deficient in that area and a Judge may raise the difficulty on a roll because of it. 
		Abilities cannot be 5’s in character generation. 5’s need to be achieved through in game experience. A four is allowed though needs to be thoroughly 
		explained in the Character’s prelude somewhere.</em></p>
		
	<h3>Specialties</h3>
	<p>Choose two specialties in any Ability the character has at least 1 dot in. Staff will add two more specialties to the character’s sheet based on the 
		character’s concept or plot hooks. A character may purchase a new specialty for 5 experience points. Ability specialties give the character one extra 
		die for rolls that the Judge deems a specialty is valid in.</p>
	<p>Once an Ability reaches rank 5 all specialties turn into ‘Masteries’ and take away a ‘1’ on every roll using that mastery.</p>
	<h4>Example:</h4>
	<blockquote>Lenny the lounge Lizard has a specialty in ‘Carousing’ under his ‘persuasion’ Ability. If he had a 3 in Charisma and a 3 in Persuasion 
		any roll used for Carousing would add a die to the total. (7 dice to roll) If he had ‘Persuasion’ as a Mastery a single ‘1’ rolled would be ignored.
		So every roll of 7 or more counts as a success towards his goal!</blockquote>
