<p>Even the dead dream of paradise.</p>
<p>That dream is the Millenial City, a city that can support a thousand Kindred comfortably.</p>
<p>That city is New Amsterdam.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a tale of the Vampires that call themselves Kindred.  A thousand human analogues influence the city; undead husks that pretend to be mortal men.  Despite this ‘masquerade’ their Elders long ago forgot what it was really like to be humane.  These Lords of the Night are deadly caricatures that most wish would stay asleep.  Kindred bodies lost their warmth long ago, now the trick is to stave off the cooling of the soul.</p>
<h3>Kindred Template Generation:</h3>
<p>Staff will be more than happy to help players that are unfamiliar with the basic abilities in the old WOD books in regard to character generation. The only thing you need to bring to the table is a concept.</p>
<h3>The Camarilla</h3>
<p>This is the monolithic society of the damned.  A note on the ‘Camarilla’: While the organization you will be living under the rule of is called the Camarilla, and is loosely based on the Camarilla in the sourcebooks it will not be exactly the same. Some differences may be very significant, and it may not be the only or dominant source of power or authority.</p>
<p>The only Vampires available as your first character in the LARP are the Camarilla Clans, excluding the Tremere, which are not available without having ‘unlocked’ Plot points through game play.  These are the six Clans that are in Ascendancy within New Amsterdam. Ascendancy is a term that can be traced back to the Kindred's Seventh tradition.  Kindred bloodlines that comprise a large population within the city are considered to be in 'ascendancy' and have a seat on the Prince's Council.   Not every city has the same number of Clans in ascendancy.</p>
<p>Some have Clans you've never even heard of.</p>
<p>The following is a brief list of the Clans that players can choose from:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Brujah (The Abacti)</dt>
	<dd><p>The Iconoclasts of the Vampire world. This diverse Clan attracts everyone from rebels to Intellectual professors looking to change society. (Note: They are very different from the standard Brujah in old WoD)</p>
		<p>Disciplines:  Celerity (Super speed, greatly altered in our game), Potence (Super Strength), Presence (An aura of power), and the Clan Secret</p></dd>

	<dt>Gangrel</dt>
	<dd><p>Those Kindred that are attuned to their primal, bestial natures. Rumor has it that they originated in the Gladiatorial arenas of Rome. </p>
	<p>Disciplines: Animalism (Control of animals), Fortitude (Super health), Protean (Animal aspects/transformations), and the Clan Secret</p></dd>
	
	<dt>Malkavian</dt>
	<dd><p>The Clan of madmen and prophets.  Their bloodline is tainted (or gifted depending on your opinion) with derangement.</p>
	<p>Disciplines: Auspex (Vampyric senses), Dominate (Mind Control), Obfuscate (Hiding), and the Clan Secret</p></dd>
	
	<dt>Nosferatu</dt>
	<dd><p>Cursed by a monstrous appearance, the Nosferatu live ‘below’ and are have an extensive spy network.</p>
	<p>Disciplines: Animalism (Control of animals), Obfuscate (Hiding) , Potence (Super Strength), and the Clan Secret</p></dd>
	
	<dt>Toreador</dt>
	<dd><p>The socialites of Kindred society.  They are the vampires that best emulate the positive and negative aspects of humanity.</p>
	<p>Disciplines: Auspex (Vampyric senses), Celerity (Super speed, greatly altered in our game), Presence (An aura of power), and the Clan Secret</p></dd>
	
	<dt>Ventrue</dt>
	<dd><p>The Nobility of the damned.  They are the most influential vampires in mortal society.</p>
	<p>Disciplines: Dominate (Mind control), Fortitude (Super health), Presence (An aura of power), and the Clan Secret</p></dd>
	
	<dt>Caitiff</dt>
	<dd><p>The Clanless.  They are the ones who, for some reason are not connected with an established bloodline.</p>
	<p>Disciplines:  Any three you choose, but no Clan Secret</p></dd>

<h3>Kindred Specific Qualities</h3>
<h4>Virtues</h4>
<p>All Kindred start with one free dot in each of the three virtues and allocate seven more dots.  These are the virtues:</p>
<p><h5>Conscience:</h5>The fading aspect of a Vampire’s mortal morality.  It is rolled whenever a Kindred makes a humanity check.</p>
<p><h5>Self Control:</h5>How well a Vampire can stave off the beast within him and resist a frenzy check.</p>
<p><h5>Courage:</h5>Even Vampires fear final death.  This is the Virtue that represents how a Kindred faces his innate fear of fire.  It is used in rotschreck rolls.</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
	<dt>Humanity</dt>
	<dd>is equal to the combined scores of Conscience and Self Control.</dd>
	
	<dt>Willpower</dt>
	<dd>is equal to the character's Courage rating.</dd>
	
	<dt>Blood pool</dt>
	<dd>is equal to the character's <em>Stamina attribute</em> +10.  The background <em>Generation</em> may raise this though speak to staff, <em>Generation</em>has greatly changed in our game.</dd>
</dl>
