	<h1>Character Submission</h1>
	<p>
		All character submissions are to be sent to staff prior to the deadline. (email both the prelude and proposed stats to:
		<a href="mailto:staff@crimsonaccord.com">staff@crimsonaccord.com</a>) This will insure that approved characters can be added to the Master database 
		and be ready to play next game. Both Attributes and Abilities are rated from 1 to 5. The breakdown of how each dot is represented can be found 
		<a href="index.php?page=attributes_abilities.html">here</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Attributes</h2>
	<p>
		Attributes represent a character's raw talent and potential.  These qualities are broken up into three categories: Physical, Social and Mental. 
		Determine which Attribute group will be Primary, which will be secondary and which will be tertiary. (Ex. A Detective concept may choose Mental as 
		the Primary group, Physical as the Secondary and Social as the Tertiary group.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each Attribute starts at one dot and may be raised with additional dots based on the player's attribute grouping: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Primary group: 7 extra dots to allocate </li>
		<li>Secondary group: 5 extra dots to allocate </li>
		<li>Tertiary group: 3 extra dots to allocate </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Note: Leaving an Attribute at a 1 is allowable if it conforms to the concept of the character. Staff considers low Attributes to be a great way to 
		roleplay deficiencies to overcome. Players will need both experience and an in game reason to buy an attribute up from a 1 to a 2. (This is to prevent 
		min-maxing though still let someone who wants to roleplay a concept with a deficient attribute to explore that aspect of the character.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Attributes cannot be 5's in character generation. 5's need to be achieved through in game experience.
	</p>
	<h4>Specialties:</h4>
	<p>
		A character may claim a specialty for every dot above 3. So a 4 in an attribute would allow one specialty, a 5 allows two specialties. 
		Attribute Specialties may not be bought with Experience. Each roll that involves an attribute specialty will allow every '10' rolled to count as 2 
		successes. (This eliminates the hassle of re-rolling 10's and accruing a botch.)
	</p>
	<h2>Abilities</h2>
	<p>
		Abilities represent a character's experience and expertise.  Players have 27 points to distribute among their Abilities.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each Ability starts at zero dots and may be raised with additional dots.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: Having a zero in an Ability means the character is deficient in that area and a Judge may raise the difficulty on a roll because of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Abilities cannot be 5's in character generation. 5's need to be achieved through in game experience. A four is allowed though needs to be thoroughly 
		explained in the Character's prelude somewhere.
	</p>
	<h4>Specialties:</h4>
	<p>
		Choose three specialties in any Ability the character has at least 1 dot in. A character may purchase a new specialty for 3 experience points. 
		Ability specialties give the character one extra die for rolls that the Judge deems a specialty is valid in.
	</p>
	<h2>Supernatural Template</h2>
	<p>Non-Mortals Choose from one of the following templates:</p>
	<ul class="list-inline">
		<li><a href="index.php?page=werewolf.html">Garou</a></li>
		<li><a href="index.php?page=vampire.html">Kindred</a></li>
		<li><a href="index.php?page=mage.html">Mage</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>
	<p>Next each character has 5 points to spend on Backgrounds.</p>
	<h4>Freebie Points</h4>
	<p><em>Note: Anything raised above 3 with Freebie Points cost double.</em></p>
	<p>Each player will have 15 points to spend on freebies.  Freebie points can be spent to raise anything on a character sheet by one dot per expenditure. The following is the cost for raising each area:</p>
