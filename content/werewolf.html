<p>Due to the Shifter theme of 'a dying breed fighting overwhelming odds' we are limiting Shifter applications which are currently: Open</p>
<div class="werewolf">We guard against those things that live 'beyond'.  They were driven back at a great price.  Driven back, yet not defeated.</div>
<p>Werewolves exist, though they do not go by such vulgar terms.</p>
<p>They are called The Garou. Garou culture and the core ideas of the Tribes pre-dates human culture. But at some points throughout history each Tribe has had areas of the world where it focused much of its presence. By doing so the lines between Garou and Human culture thinned and they both influenced each other. Even though most Tribes traveled widely, the places they dealt with most strongly and stayed longest became cultural touchstones for the Tribe. Garou Tribes are not bound by any human culture, though they often reflect elements of them and hail from common genetic stock.</p>
<h4>Garou Template Generation:</h4>
<p>Staff will be more than happy to help players in regard to character generation.  The only thing you need to bring to the table is a concept.</p>
