					climbing up the stairs.  The hum of a motor overhead drew the attention of the hallway's single occupant upwards towards the skylight 
					above him as he patiently waited for his would be assailants.</p>
					<p>The illumination from a dirigible's advertisement beamed through the antique skylight like rays of false sunshine, casting a bluish glow
