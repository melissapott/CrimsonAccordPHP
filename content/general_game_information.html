<h1>General Game Information</h1>
<p>Crimson Accord is loosely based on the 'old' White-Wolf Revised Vampire, Mage and Werewolf systems, with significant modification to rules and cosmology, with a healthy disregard for 'canon'.</p>

<p>This will be a Vampire/Werewolf/Mage crossover LARP. The majority of the LARP characters will be Camarilla Vampires and Werewolves of the Thirteen Tribes of the Garou Nation or members of the Orders of Magi. Ghouls and Kinfolk tied to the above mentioned Clans or Tribes will also be welcome. On a case by case basis, and with a player cap, Gypsy/Romany and Techno-Mage characters will be considered. At this time we do not expect to allow any other submissions. No other Vampire Clans, no obscure Sects or Bloodlines of Kindred or Garou, no other Shapeshifters, no other types of supernatural creatures.</p>

<p>While Vampires and Werewolves are allowed, Abominations will NOT be. Groups and Races not mentioned as the base foundation of splats in the game will need to be 'unlocked' with <a href="index.php?page=plot_points.html">Plot Points</a> at a later time.</p>

<p>The setting is a version of modern day Manhattan. The city, the world, and the history of the world have been fictionalized and modified. Those modifications which would be common knowledge will be posted.</p>

<p>All players must be 18 and up with verifiable ID.</p>

<p>All approved character concepts must also be adults, 18 and up.</p>
