<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<p>Anyone can submit a Mortal, Werewolf, Sorcerer or Vampire concept that does not fall into the category of 'antagonist'. No Black Spirals, Sabbat or 
other non-Camarilla Clan concept will be accepted. There is a plot point system in play that will allow antagonists and other character types 
to be unlocked by the player at a later date. Information on this can be found in the <a href="/index.php?page=plot_points.html">Plot Point</a> section.</p>
 

<h3>Character Template</h3>
<p>
All supernatural characters were either embraced or changed anywhere from one to three months prior to the first game. If you have strong in character 
reasons to be as much as a year old, please contact the staff for approval. This insures that the player will be immersed in a story rife with unknowns 
and mysteries to uncover. People who read our House Rules section noticed that we are not using any one set of core rules. We changed the history and 
structure of the world as well. The fluff some players may have read in a variety of rulebooks may not exist in our game, or may not be what some players 
think. The Giovanni may very well be a bloodline of diabolists… just like the rumor you heard in game said. The only way to find out the truth is to do so 
in game, not by reading a book. Those emotions linked to the unknown are a defining mood for the game, which is why we not only changed the fluff… we 
completely altered the very world the characters live in.

<h3>Mortal Prelude Questions</h3>
<p>
All characters came from somewhere. Even people who were transformed into 'something else' still have anchors and touchstones of foundation and meaningful 
history in mortal society, especially the newly transformed like the new characters in our LARP. The Storytellers want to know what these anchors and 
touchstones are. The more information a player gives us, the more we understand who their character is in our unique world, city, story and plot. This allows 
us to understand what matters to your character and craft stories that we hope you will find more fun and engrossing.
</p>
<p>
Bearing in mind that your character is very new to the world of the supernatural (and in some cases not even yet aware of it) please answer at least seven 
of the following prelude question groups (1/3rd of them)… though you certainly welcome to answer as many more than that as you like. Responses often include 
additional short narratives or blurbs that the player feels are relevant in fleshing their character out.
</p>
<p>
Our game kicked off with the fictional destruction of the United Nations on February 29th, 2000. As of the last revision of these questions (done IRL on 
October 22, 2012) our in game timeline as reached March 1st, 2005. Be aware that in our world many elements of mortal and supernatural history, culture and 
cosmology are different from both the real world and the published World of Darkness. These questions also help us to bring characters smoothly into line
with our unique universe.

Note: Unless the people mentioned are also specified as linked to Backgrounds, Merits or Flaws (i.e.: Mentor, Ally, Retainer, Enemy, Ward, etc…) this 
information will be used for character development purposes and as springboards and story hooks for plots to naturally flesh out your characters place in the 
world and mesh you into our plots and storyline.
