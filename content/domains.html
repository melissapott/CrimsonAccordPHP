<h1>Domains</h1>
<h3>Definition:</h3>
<p>A Domain is an important location within a city that can be influenced, controlled or outright bought by a character. They confer certain bonuses on the character that ‘owns’ them and need to be acquired through the use of Backgrounds. </p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Each Domain has a rating from one to five and is usually associated with an Ability or sphere of influence. (A bar where criminals frequent would be under the ‘street’ influence sphere as well as ‘Larceny’) If this bar was a 2 dot Domain it could be used as an Ic reason to buy up Contacts, Allies or maybe even Retainers up to a 2 (the level of the Domain) with experience. Note: This is the quickest and easiest way to raise Background dots. Backgrounds need serious In Character reasons to be raised. </li>
	<li>The benefits may be transferred to another player on a month by month basis, allowing other people to borrow your Domain benefit. Backgrounds can only be raised one dot per game. This makes controlling a Domain an in game commodity that is the backbone of the system of Kindred Prestation. (Accruing favors called Boons that become legal transactions among the Kindred.) </li>
</ol>

<h3>Acquiring Domains:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open Domains are added to a player’s Character Packet. These are the important locations that for whatever reason are not being controlled by anyone. Players who want to begin the process of acquiring a Domain need to find one of the Storytellers and make a roll. One Domain roll may be made at game and a Variety of rolls may be made as in between game actions depending on how many Background dots are being allocated to the roll. </li>
	<li>Once a player allocates certain Background Dots to a Domain roll they are considered ‘Tapped’, which means they cannot be used for any other type of roll. Example: A player wants to own that criminal bar and decides to ‘TAP’ three of his four dots of Resources to try and buy it. He would roll an appropriate attribute (Intelligence, Manipulation etc…) + 3 dice for the Resources he tapped. Every three successes on the roll means one dot of the Domain is under the player’s control. </li>
	<li>Staff will ask the player about details and record them on an index card that will be filed. Note: Multiple players may very well control different Dots in the same Domain! This is when Staff tells you there is something blocking their efforts and players will need to find out who the competition is and either come to some form of agreement or decide to attack each others bid for control.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<em>Example:</em>
<p>Tom and Jerry decide they both want to vie for a 2 point domain. This is a pretty nice location so they both decide to ‘Tap’ several dots of backgrounds for this. Tom gets 4 successes on his roll during the Game. (Giving him one dot of control over that area) Jerry gets 3 successes, acquiring the other dot. Nothing more can be done until either they come to an agreement or attack each others Domains. (Domain attack rules will come later) Note: NPCs also have a stake in Domains, some may even have dots of control!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Sanctioned Domains:</h3>
<p>Once a player controls every Dot of a Domain he could petition his Elders/Leader to acknowledge that he is the sanctioned owner of that domain. Kindred petitioning for a one to three dot Domain only have to petition their Primogen. Four or more dots require the Prince’s sanction. All Kindred should go through a Censor to try and sanction their Domains.  Non-Kindred usually have an easier time to sanction a Domain yet lack the vast structure and protection that Kindred society affords its members.</p>
<p>Note for Kindred: Clans in Ascendancy usually have feeding grounds that encompass large swaths of the city. Speaking to them in regard to control of a specific location that falls in their territory isn’t necessary… but it is highly recommended if the player wants to avoid complications later.</p>

<h3>Replenishing Backgrounds:</h3>
<p>Backgrounds may be used at game.  If the situation warrants the use of a background Staff will inform the player and one or more dots will be 'tapped' (filled in on the character sheet.).  Rolls will be made and the background will be utilized.  All Backgrounds untap at the end of the downtime phase of each game.  this means that Backgrounds that were tapped  during game can't be used for actions in between games during the same game session.  (Ex: Someone with a 3 in Contacts wants to find information out during game.  One of their dots is 'tapped' at game (bubbled in by Staff) and rolls are made.</p>
<p>During that character's down time actions (the actions that may be initiated in between game.) they only have two Contact dots to use.  Once Downtime actions are concluded all Background dots are untapped/refreshed to be used again at the next game.</p>
