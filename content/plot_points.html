<h1>Plot Points</h1>
<p>The Storytellers want to reward the players that contribute to the game above and beyond the actions and interests of their characters. The players who costume above and beyond what is generally expected, who add to the setting by bringing their own props and running locations and people who volunteer play time to help us judge scenes or run plots will be rewarded. </p>
<p>Plot Points can be spent on a variety of rewards that range from unlocking races that are not available from the start (Antagonists like the Sabbat, Mages or even Mummies are an example of this) to character specific rewards like re-writing a character death. These are plot ‘retcons’ that will allow Staff to write in how your character survived. (Your character may be alive, yet they woke up looking at their body strapped to a mad scientist’s table because they are a brain in a jar.)</p>
