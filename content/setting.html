<h1>Setting</h1>
<p>Alternate history fiction is fast becoming a genre unto itself. Students of history learn that events can be described as 'cause and effect' chains. Events that occurred decades, centuries or even millenia ago would change the direction of our future. The world would not be as we know it.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where the Dutch lost the colony of New Amsterdam. Would the British have taken it over? If so, what would its name be? What would have happened to the massive Native American enclave out on Long Island if there wasn't a prevalent Dutch influence in the area? Questions like these would set the imagination in motion. History would have taken a much different route if the Republic of Texas was not a staunch ally of the United States, or if the Czar's White Army wasn't able to retreat to the Alaskan enclave via the trans-Siberian railroad.</p>
<p>The world would not be as we know it.</p>
<p>The game is set in modern times, starting from May 2000 and progressing onward. The dust has yet to settle from the Anarchist bombing of the United Nations. The chaos that ensued threatened to destroy the city as systematic attacks began occurring at key locations within New Amsterdam. Martial law had to be declared.</p>
<p>Our story begins with the events that occurred afterwards.</p>
